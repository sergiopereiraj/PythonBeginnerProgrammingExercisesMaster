# `15` Looping With FizzBuzz

This is a typical beginner test that is required to complete interviews in Google, Facebook and all the other big tech unicorns.


## üìù Instructions:

1. Write the code needed to print in the console all the numbers from 1 to 100:

+ For multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Fizz".
 
+ For multiples of 5, print "Buzz". 

+ For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".


## Expected result:

```py

1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
....
....
98

Buzz


```
